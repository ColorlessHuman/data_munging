# Data Munging
## Part One: Weather Data
In weather.dat you'll find weather data for Morristown for June 2002. Write a program to output the day number with the smallest temperature spread.  
------
## Part Two: Soccer League Table
The file football.dat contains results from English Premier League for 2001/2002. The columns labelled 'F' and 'A' contain the total number of goals scored for and against each team in that season. Write a program to print the name of the team with the smallest difference in 'for' and 'against' goal.   
-------
## Part Three: DRY Fusion
Take the two programs written previously and factor out as much common code as possible, leaving you with two smaller programs and some kind of shared functionality.
